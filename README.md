# Phil Nguyen - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Phil! I have a teaching background and this is a portfolio of data analytics related projects. I have a strong foundation in STEM and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics.

This repository consists of topics and projects to develop my skills in my free time, as I explore and learning data analysis tools and techniques. Learning is a life long journey and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
